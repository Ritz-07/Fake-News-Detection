# Fake-News-Detection

Done as part of final year academic project. The aim of the project is to correctly classify news articles as Fake or Real. Fake news in the recent times has been a matter of concern for a lot of organizations and authorities and is an active area of research. The idea behind the project was to achieve better results than a paper that worked on the similar problem. The entire problem has been broken down to the following chunks: <br>

1) Data Preparation and Cleaning
2) Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
3) Featurization of text data
4) Modelling (using ML)
5) Deployment

The solution was locally deployed. The primary metric chosen for the project was F1 score and accuracy was chosen as the secondary metric along with confusion matrix. 
The project is a team project with one other contributor.
